                <h3>How We Use Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.
                </p>
                <h3>Cookies and tracking technologies we use</h3>
                <p>
                    Where [sitesy-sitename] talk about cookies and tracking technology on our websites we refer to the following:
                </p>
                <h3>Web Beacons</h3>
                <p>
                    To help us better manage content we employ web beacons in emails that we send to our subscribers. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier and are used to track the online movements of internet users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. We use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients enabling us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
                </p>
                <h3>Pixels</h3>
                <p>
                    A pixel refers to the code that is placed on your computer in order to trigger a cookie. We sometimes use this methodology to allow us to deliver more relevant messages to you.
                </p>
                <h3>Log Files</h3>
                <p>
                    We use log files to record events that occur on our websites. This may include, though not exclusively, the type, content or time of transaction made via your device. These audit trails allow us to analyze activities on our websites.
                </p>
                <h3>How and why we use cookies and tracking technologies</h3>
                <p>
                    Types of Cookies and how they are set
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two types of cookies:
                </p>

                    <li>“Session Cookies” – Stored temporarily in your computer’s memory while you are visiting a website and are deleted when you close your browser.</li>
                    <li>“Persistent Cookies” – Stored for a set period on your computer and used to determine whether there has been any contact between us and your computer in the past.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    There are two ways cookies set can be on our websites:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“1st Party Cookies” – cookies that are set by the website domain (or belonging to a sub domain) of the website.</li>
                    <li>“3rd Party Cookies” – cookies that are set by another website domain. (e.g. by one of our main technology partners or by an external web service).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cookies Classification</h3>
                <p>
                    We are categorising cookies set on the site by ourselves and main technology partners into the following categories:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Category 1:</b> Strictly necessary cookies
                </p>
                <p>
                    These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around a website and use it features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, services you've asked for (such as access to secure areas) can't be provide. These cookies don't gather information about you that can be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Category 2:</b> Performance cookies
                </p>
                <p>
                    These cookies collect information about how you use a website, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get any error messages from certain pages.

These cookies are not used to target you with online advertising. Without these cookies we can't learn how our website is performing and make relevant improvements that could better your browsing experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Category 3:</b> Functionality Cookies
                </p>
                <p>
                    These cookies allow a website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you’re in) and tailor the website to provide enhanced features and content for you. For instance, they can be used to remember log-in details, changes you’ve made to text size, font and other parts of pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you’ve asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. These cookies may be used to ensure that all our services and communications are relevant to you. The information these cookies collect cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. Without these cookies, a website cannot remember choices you’ve previously made or personalise your browsing experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Category 4:</b> Targeting and advertising cookies
                </p>
                <p>

Without these cookies, online adverts you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests. We also enable some advertising partners to set cookies specifically to enable them to analyse advertising campaign performance. 
                </p>
                <h3>The Cookies We Set</h3>
                <ul>
